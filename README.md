# An Informative Web Scraper #
* Author: Harris Zheng  
* Date: Feb 23, 2020 
* Abstract: A JavaScript/Node.js Program that stores information about the user's Upper Year Engineering Courses. 
* The main intent of this program is to give the user the ability to assess Upper Year course selection choices.
* Right now, the program is able to assess AU Units, which quantifies how many credits that an Engineer needs 
* to fulfill CEAB Requirements: https://engineerscanada.ca/accreditation/about-accreditation  
* User Features:
*  - User can upload a JSON database of course information from local repository.
*  - User can save multiple JSON databases of course information from local repository, allowing 
*    power to assess multiple profiles.   
*  - User can add courses.
*  - User can remove courses.
*  - User can calculate the amount of AU units of his courses instantaneously as courses
*    are being removed -- unlike on the UofT website, where an entire profile has to be submitted for 
*    AU units to be seen. 
* Program Features:
*  - Cheerio to scrape data on UofT's Upper Year Courses.
*  - Node.js backend,  HTML, SASS, JavaScript front end. 
*    Table template is borrowed from https://colorlib.com/wp/css3-table-templates/
